            Hey, there. My name's Andrew. I'm currently working a fulltime retail job. But since I’d rather have a more fulfilling career,
            I’ve started the process of becoming a certified Full Stack Developer. But this isn’t the first time I’ve had
            an interest in coding.
            <br><br> In high school, I took my first html class. It was only the very basics, html pages with no linked style sheets
            or JavaScript. I was able to get a handle on it without much trouble. The fact that I was basically leading the
            class gave me the confidence to seek out a higher education in the wild world of web design.
            <br><br> I ended up attending college with a focus in “Digital Media”, a major that has since changed names, so I’m not
            sure if I should still list it on my resume. While I did graduate with a bachelor’s degree, I never got around
            to finding a career in the coding industry. Since then, I think I might have forgotten half as much as I learned.
            <br><br> Now I’m back in the classroom, eager to brush up on what I’ve already learned and catch up on what I’ve missed.
            Here’s to and exciting six months!
            <br><br> -Andrew-
